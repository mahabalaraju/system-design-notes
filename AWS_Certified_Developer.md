 How do you choose AWS region ?  
 
 compliance: with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission 
 
 proximity to customers : reduced latency 
 
 available services within a region : new services and new features aren't available in every region 
 
 pricing : pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page. 
                                                                                      ---------
                                                                                         IAM:
                                                                                      ---------


IAM --> Identity and access management, global service
Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared 
users are people within your organisation, and can be grouped
groups contains only users and not other groups
users don't have to belong to a group and user can belong to multiple groups

IAM permissions

users or groups can be assigned json documents called policies
these policies define teh persmissions of the users 
In aws you apply the least privilege principle : don't give more permissions than a user needs

IAM policies inheritance 

group policy: will apply for all the developers. they will inherit that. 
Even if the same person is in other group he'll also get the access of other 

test-developer :  https://115154236565.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
username       : test-developer
Password       : Hmbr@1997


coming to the password policy you have default and custom as well where you can set your own like number of characters , symbols , length , expiration time and you have dashboard to configure --> account settings and password policy 

and you can enable MFA by IAM -> security credentials 

How you can access AWS ?

AWS management console (protected by password + MFA) 
AWS commandline interface (CLI) : protected by access keys 
AWS software developer kit (SDK) : for code : protected by access keys 

access keys are generated through the aws console 
user_name ~= accesskey Id 
password ~= SecretAccess key 


AWS cli : its a tool that enables you to intract with aws services using commands in your command line shell 
direct access to the public apis of AWS services 
its open source . alternative to the aws management console where you can develop the scripts to manage your resources . 


AWS SDK : (software development kit) 

language specific APIs (set of libraries)
enables you to access and manage aws services programmatically 
embedded within your application
